# Introduction
This is just me messing about with Python & JSON files. There are better ways to do this I'm sure, and also manipulating globals() is probably not good practice either!

**Notice:** :warning: The `TextGame2.py` is not fully functional (the version that uses the JSON file) as described [below](#file-information) :warning:

# Version Information
Python Version: `3.6.1`

There are no other dependencies for this project.

# File Information
- TextGame1.py - This version of the game hardcodes the story via the use of functions (works)
- TextGame2.py - This is the WIP version which reads the scenes from a JSON file (json_test.json) (doesn't work - you can't 'beat' the game as that functionality doesn't exist yet)
- InventoryTest.py - Was just testing JSON writing and loading!
