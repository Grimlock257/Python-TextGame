This is just me messing about with Python & JSON files. There are better ways to do this I'm sure, and also manipulating globals() is probably not good practice either!

TextGame1.py - This version of the game hardcodes the story via the use of functions (works)
TextGame2.py - This is the WIP version which reads the scenes from a JSON file (json_test.json) (doesn't work - you can't 'beat' the game as that functionality doesn't exist yet)
